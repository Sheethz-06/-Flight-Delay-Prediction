# -Flight-Delay-Prediction
This project uses the Kaggle Flight Delay dataset to predict the likelihood of flight delays based on various features such as origin, destination, airline, and flight schedule. The goal is to create an accurate predictive model to assist airlines, passengers, and airport management in better decision-making.

Dataset

Source

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: Flight Delay Dataset

Features

FlightNumber: Unique identifier for the flight.

Airline: The airline operating the flight.

OriginAirport: Code for the origin airport.

DestinationAirport: Code for the destination airport.

ScheduledDeparture: Scheduled time of departure.

ScheduledArrival: Scheduled time of arrival.

Distance: Distance between the origin and destination.

DelayMinutes: Actual delay in minutes (target variable).

Target Variable

DelayBinary: A binary label indicating whether the flight was delayed (1) or on-time (0).

Prerequisites

Libraries and Tools

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

xgboost

lightgbm

tensorflow/keras (optional for advanced models)

You can install these libraries with the following command:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm

Workflow

Data Exploration and Preprocessing

Load the dataset and inspect its structure.

Handle missing values and outliers.

Encode categorical variables (e.g., airline, airport codes).

Feature engineering (e.g., extract time-based features like hour, day of the week).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize data distributions and correlations.

Identify patterns between features and delays.

Model Training

Split the dataset into training and test sets.

Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, or LightGBM.

Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Optimization

Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

Use cross-validation to ensure model generalizability.

Deployment

Save the trained model using joblib or pickle.

Deploy the model as a web service using Flask or FastAPI.
